Hello, World!

Found_lost is a project based on the idea of finding an object you have lost and finding the owner of something you have found.
Users have to sign up and log in in order to report something they have found or claim something that belongs to them and has lost it.
A user doesn't have to sign up or login in order to see the list of objects found.
